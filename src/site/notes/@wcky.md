# ⌁ Hey there, I'm George ⌁

I am working towards a locally connected world through addiction cessation, education, and rewilding. I am currently studying full-time, and volunteering away the remainder.

### PROJECTS

#### DEMO AREA FOR GOSFORTH NATURE RESERVE (2025 - )

Covering a small area near the entrance of [Gosforth Nature Reserve](https://www.nhsn.org.uk/), the proposed idea would help inspire the next generation of environmentalists and teach about the inner workings of the natural world. 

I have plans to begin through Winter for it to be completed by Spring 2026. I will post full updates on this site.

#### BADGER WALKS (2025 - )

Sounds funny, and I promise we didn't dress up as badger's and walk the streets. Rather, I ran walks at a local nature reserve to find the elusive badger. It was very successful, with hopes of bringing it back in 2026.
#### PEACEFUL FOUNDATION (2024 - )

I volunteer some of my time to help with a wonderful charity. Ran by someone I am lucky enough to call a friend, [Peaceful](https://peacefulfoundation.org/) is a charity that purely focuses on building local community through solving addiction and other widespread anomalies. The methods *actually* work, with the most popular being *The Easy Peasy Way To Quit Porn* which is adapted from Allen Carr's *Easy Way*.
